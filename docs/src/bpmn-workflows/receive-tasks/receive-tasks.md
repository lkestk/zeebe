# Receive Tasks

Receive tasks are tasks which references a message. They are used to wait until a proper message is received.

![Receive Tasks](/bpmn-workflows/receive-tasks/receive-tasks.png)

When a receive task is entered then a corresponding message subscription is created. The workflow instance stops at this point and waits until the message is correlated.

A message can published using one of the Zeebe clients. When the message is correlated, the receive task gets completed and the workflow instance continues.

> An alternative to receive tasks are [message intermediate catch events](/bpmn-workflows/message-events/message-events.html) which behaves the same but can be used together with event-based gateways.

## Messages

A message can be referenced by one or more receive events. It **must** define the name of the message (e.g. `Money collected`) and the `correlationKey` expression (e.g. `= orderId`).

The `correlationKey` is an expression that usually [accesses a variable](/reference/expressions.html#access-variables) of the workflow instance that holds the correlation key of the message. The expression is evaluated on activating the receive task and must result either in a `string` or in a `number`.

In order to correlate a message to the receive task, the message is published with the defined name (e.g. `Money collected`) and the **value** of the `correlationKey` expression. For example, if the workflow instance has a variable `orderId` with value `"order-123"` then the message must be published with the correlation key `"order-123"`.

## Variable Mappings

By default, all message variables are merged into the workflow instance. This behavior can be customized by defining an output mapping at the receive task.
